= Annex 1. Transition from Old to new CompletePreferenceImpl Class

====== link:../README.adoc[Summary]

=== Both current classes Diagram

Currently, there are two classes representing a complete preference. To distinguish them, one is named 'Old'. Below are their class diagrams.

When the first class only has one attribute representing the preference by a List<Set<Alternative>>, the other one has four attributes. Its preference is represented by a ImmutableList<ImmutableSet<Alernative>> but also has a graph, a voter and a set of alternatives.

To better see the difference between the two classes, we made a table highlighting of their respective methods, so you understand what correponds between the two classes.

Here is the comparative table :

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"] 
|===
|Equivalent method in OldCompletePreferenceImpl
|Equivalent method in CompletePreferenceImpl
|Contract

|getPreferencesNonStrict ()
|asEquivalenceClasses ()
|Returns the preference attribute of the class (a List<Set<Alternative>>).

|getAlternative (Integer position)
|getAlternatives (int rank)
|Returns the alternative at the given rank.

|size (List<Set<Alternative>> list)
|/
|Returns the number of alternatives in the preference.

|contains (Alternative alter)
|/
|Says whether an alternative is the preference.

|hasSameAlternatives (OldCompletePreferenceImpl p)
|/
|Says whether two preferences have the same alternatives (not in the same order).

|isIncludedIn (OldCompletePreferenceImpl p)
|/
|Says whether the preference is included in given one ( if it contains all alternatives of the given preference).

|getAlternativeRank (Alternative alter)
|getRank (Alternative a)
|Returns the rank of a given alternative.

|toAlternativeSet (List<Set<Alternative>> preference)
|toALternativeSet (ImmuatbleList<ImmutableSet<Alternative>> preference)
|Returns a alternatives Set with all the alternatives in the List of Sets.

|isStrict ()
|/
|Says whether the preference is strict (no ex√¶quo).

|toStrictPreference ()
|/
|If the preference is strict, returns the LinearPreference created from the complete one.

|/
|getVoter ()
|Returns the voter associated to this preference.

|/
|createGraph (List<? extends Set<Alternative>> equivalenceClasses)
|Create the graph associated to the preference (each node is an alternative and an edge from node a to node b means a>=b).

|/
|asGraph ()
|Returns the graph associated to the preference.

We can see that a replacement from the old class to the new class cannot be done at this stage at all.
Indeed, it was be necessary to start by adapting the code of the new one to meet the needs currently provided in the old one.

Specifically, we needed to create the missing methods such as :

* size(List<Set<Alternative>> list) that we will rename atlernativeNumber.
* contains(Alternative alter). This method uses the toAlternativeSet method but be careful, in the OldCP the method accepts a List<Set<Alernative>> and in the new one only a ImmutableList<ImmutableSet<Alernative>>.
* hasSameAlternatives(OldCompletePreferenceImpl p).
* isIncludedIn(OldCompletePreferenceImpl p).
* isStrict().
* toStrictPreference().

We made those, but some change still need to be made to replace OldCompletePreference by CompletePreferencein in the Profile Interfaces and classes.
