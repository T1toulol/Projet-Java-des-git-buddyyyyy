== DOT FORMAT


=== PRESENTATION:

The DOT format is a simple file format which describes graphs. This type of file is used by graph visualization applications.
The DOT format describes three types of objects: graphs, nodes and edges.
Graphs can be directed (indicated by the keyword digraph) or undirected (graph).
A graph can be used to represent a classification between elements.
In the case of a link:./preferenceInterfaces.adoc[Preference], the graph will be necessarily oriented, because a Preference is a ranking of Alternatives.

=== SYNTAX:

The DOT’s syntax is quite simple. The first line indicates the type of the graph and its name.
Then, the following lines, which are between brackets, represent vertices and edges.
A vertex is created when its name appears for the first time in the list.
An edge is created when the vertices are connected by an edge operator: - - for an undirected graph and - > for a directed one.
We can also create a subgraph which is a subset of edges.


=== ATTRIBUTES:

The DOT format also allows to specify attributes in order to modify the graph representation and the arrangement of vertices and edges. The attributes are indicated between [] after the vertex or the edge they refer to.
Here are some attributes:
- size, to set the size of the graph (in inches)
- shape, to set the shape of the edge
- style, to set the style of the vertex
- color, to set the edge’s color
- …
The keyword edge allows to define attributes associated to all the edges at the same time. Like-wise, for the keyword node for the vertices.
Finally, the DOT format represents a graph in different layers.


=== EXAMPLE :

Here we imagine a Preference between the Alternatives "The X-Files", "The Punisher", and "Shreck".

The above graph is produced by the code below. It expresses the Preference of voter #37.

----
graph Votant_37 {
        bgcolor=azure;
        node [shape=box, color=blue, style=filled];
        edge [arrowsize=2, color=red];
        "The X-Files" -> "The Punisher";
        "The Punisher" -> "Shreck";
}
