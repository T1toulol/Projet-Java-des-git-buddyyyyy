=== Preference definition +
A Preference is the ranking between Alternatives.


=== MutablePreference +
A Preference where you can add Alternatives. +
You can also relate two alternatives in two ways : 

* The first one is "At least as good".
* The second one is "Equivalence".

=== AntiSymmetricPreference +
The only possible relation is "Greater than".

=== ImmutablePreference +
An Immutable Preference is a preference that cannot be modified. We can't add Alternatives or any relations.

// === MutableAntiSymmetricPreference +
// AntiSymmetricPreference + MutablePreference

// === ImmutableAntySymmetricPreference +
// AntiSymmetricPreference + ImmutablePreference

=== CompletePreference +
An ImmutablePreference where all the Alternatives have a two-to-one relation for each couple. +
A CompletePreference represents a complete preorder, also called a weak order.

=== LinearPreference +
A linear preference is an antisymmetric complete preference. A linear preference represents a linear order, or equivalently an antisymmetric complete order, or also equivalently, the reduction of a weak-order.

|Method name
|Contract
|Relevance

|asGraph()
|In the graph : a relation from a to b means "a is at least as good as b". This graph can't be modified, but is not necessarily immutable.
Reflexive and transitive.
@return the Graph corresponding to the Preference
|To do (check all overide of this methode)

|getAlternatives()
|The returned set reads through this object: if this object is mutable, any modification to this object modifies the returned set, and conversely.
@return alternatives's set
|To do (check all overide of this methode)

|getVoter()
|@return Voter instance of the preference, Returns the voter 0 if no specific voter is associated to this preference
|To do (check all overide of this methode)

|asStrictGraph()
| This method is going to be implemented in the Java iteration, and so its contract.

=== *MutablePreference*

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"] 
|===
|Method name
|Contract
|Relevance

|asMutableGraph()
| Returns the Graph corresponding to the Preference. This graph is not necessarily transitive and not necessarily reflexive.
| Need to add a decorator (check the problem with AsGraph)

|addAlternative(Alternative a)
| Adds an alternative to the Preference. This alternative is not preferred to any other of the preference, it is being added isolated.
| OK.

|addEquivalence(Alternative a1, Alternative a2)
| Adds an edge from an alternative a1 to an alternative a2 and from a2 to a1. a1 and a2 are ex-aequo.
| The method does not deal with the fact that when an alternative is not in the graph it must be added. 

|setAsLeastAsGood(Alternative a1, Alternative a2)
| Adds an edge from an alternative a1 to an alternative a2, so that a1 is asleast as good as a2 (a1 >= a2). 
| Similarly, the method does not deal with the fact that when an alternative is not in the graph it must be added.

=== *MutableAntiSymmetricPreference*

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"] 
|===
|Method name
|Contract
|Relevance

|asMutableGraph()
| This graph is not necessarily transitively closed and not necessarily reflexive. This method might refuse that an edge be added that would result in the transitive closure violating anti-symmetry, though it will not necessarily check.
| The exception is not raised. Need to add a decorator (check the problem with AsGraph)

|addAlternative(Alternative a)
| Adds an alternative to the Preference. This alternative is not preferred to any other of the preference, it is being added isolated.
| Ok.

|addStrictPreference(Alternative a1, Alternative a2)
| Adds an edge from a1 to a2, so that a1 is preferred to a2 (a1 > a2). If one of them is not in the graph, they are added.
Graph is rearranged : a transitive closure is applied to it
@param a1 preferred alternative to a2
@param a2 "lower" alternative
| Ok.

=== *ImmutablePreference*

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"] 
|===
|Method name
|Contract
|Relevance

|asGraph()
| Returns the Graph corresponding to the Preference. This graph is immutable, reflexive and transitive.
| OK. However, the method doesn't check the transitivity and reflexivity.

|getAlternatives()
| Returns an alternatives's set which is immutable.
| OK.

|Equals(Object o)
| This method is going to be implemented in the Java iteration, and so its contract.

=== *CompletePreference*

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"] 
|===
|Method name
|Contract
|Relevance

|getRank(Alternative a)
| Returns the rank of this alternative (a number between 1 and n) where n is the total number of Alternative instances.
| OK.

|getAlternatives(int rank)
| Returns the Alternative set at this rank. Empty set id there is no alternative at this rank.
| Need to add a decorator. However, the method does not handle the case of a rank bigger than the number of sets contained in equivalenceClasses.

|asEquivalenceClasses()
|Returns the same data but in an Immutable list object. A set of alternative is strictly prefered to next sets. All the alternatives in a set are considered ex-aequo.
| OK.

=== *LinearPreference*

|asList()
|Returns a sorted list of alternatives corresponding to the preference.
| OK.

=== *MutableLinearPreference*

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"] 
|===
|Method name
|Contract

|public void changeOrder(Alternative a, Int position)
|This method will reorder the Set<Alternative> and the MutableGraph<Alternative> according to parameters.

|public void reverse(Alternative a1, Alternative a2) 
|This method will switch place between 2 alternatives in the Set<Alternative> and the MutableGraph<Alternative>.

|public void deleteAlternative(Alternative a)
|Delete an alternative from the preference. Update the Set<Alternative> and the MutableGraph<Alternative>.

|public void addAlternative(Alternative a)
|Add an alternative at the end of the preference. Update the Set<Alternative> and the MutableGraph<Alternative>.
