=== What will do this class +

The goal of the ExportDOT class is to export a preference in link:./DOTformat.adoc[DOT format]. 

A preference can be represented by a *directed* graph. The preference interface has a method link:./preferenceInterfaces.adoc[asGraph()] which returns a preference as a directed graph(*). So all preferences can be converted into a directed graph and given to the Export() method of the ExportDOT class.

The Export() method of the ExportDOT class makes sure that the provided graph is a directed graph and then converts it to DOT format. Finally, the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Writer.html[Writer] given as argument provides an output stream to a file. We can create a link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html[PrintWriter] on this stream and write in the file (see the next example for more informations about write stream). 

_(*) Be carefull, currently the asGraph() method of the Preference interface returns a Graph. We can't be sure that the returned graph is oriented._
----
//Create an instance to manipulate/create a file from a path
String pathname = "./doc.txt";
File f =  new File(pathname) ;

//Create an ouput stream to the previous file
Writer writer =  new FileWriter(f);
		   
// Create a PrintWriter to write in this file
PrintWriter pw =  new PrintWriter(writer);

|Export(DirectedGraph pref, Writer w)
|This is a static void method which takes two argument : a directed graph that represents a preference and a Writer (provides an output stream to a file) which export it in DOT format. It would be useful to make sure that the export method receives a directed graph by using the isDirectedGraph() method. Then convertToDot() converts the oriented graph and sends the string to the print() method of the PrintWritter to write in the ouput file. 
|To do

|isDirectedGraph(Graph g)
|This is a static method which returns true when the argument is a directed graph.  
|To do

|convertToDoT(DirectedGraph g)
|This is a static method which returns the directed graph in DOT Format as String.
