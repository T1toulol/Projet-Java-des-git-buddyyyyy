== Strict Profile Builder

 A StrictProfile represents a complete StrictProfile. The preferences are strict. The preferences are about the same alternatives exactly.

_(*) NB : Currently, the StrictProfileBuilder class still uses the old Preference implementation (OldCompletePreferenceImpl) of the project. It should be changed to a CompletePreference.
